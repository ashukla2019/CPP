1. Creational Patterns:
provide a way to create objects without specifying how they are created, making the creation process more
flexible and less complex. They abstract the object creation logic, making it easier to manage and modify.

Singleton Pattern
Factory Pattern
Abstract Factory Pattern
Builder Pattern

2. Structural Patterns: 
Structural design patterns deal with how classes or objects are put together to form larger structures. 
They help you add new features to these structures without affecting the existing ones. So, if you need to change 
something in one part of the structure, you can do it without having to change everything else.

Adapter pattern
Proxy Pattern

3. Behavioral design patterns:
focus on how different objects in a system communicate with each other. They simplify communication and make sure that 
information is consistent and up-to-date between these objects. In other words, they help objects interact with each other
in a more organized and efficient way.

Observer Pattern (Publisher Subscriber)
Strategy Pattern
Chain of Responsibility
