/*

1.) Ordered Collection:
In std::vector all elements will remain in same order in which they are inserted.
2.) Provides random access:
Indexing is very fast in std::vector using opeartor [], just like arrays.
3.) Performance:
It Performs better if insertion and deletion is in end only and gives worst performance if insertion/deletion is at middle or at starting of vector.
4.) Contains Copy:
It always stores copy of the object not the same reference. So, if you are adding objects of user defined classes then you should define copy constructor and assignment operator in your class.

/*
vector::push_back(): This modifier pushes the elements from the back.
vector::insert(): For inserting new items to a vector at a specified location.
vector::pop_back(): This modifier removes the vector elements from the back.
vector::erase(): It is used for removing a range of elements from the specified location.
vector::clear(): It removes all the vector elements.

//How vector works internally:
/*
When std::vectorâ€™s internal memory completely finishes then it increases the size of its memory. To do that it performs following steps,

1.) It will allocate a bigger chunk of memory on heap i.e. almost double the size of previously allocated.
2.) Then it copies all the elements from old memory location to new one. Yes it copies them, so in case our elements are user defined objects then their copy constructor will be called. Which makes this step quite heavy in terms of speed.
3.) Then after successful copying it deletes the old memory.
